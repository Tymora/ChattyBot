<h2>Go to the store</h2>
<p>Imagine you need to determine whether you should go to a store. There are two variables to help you make a choice:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code class="java">isClosingSoon</code> determines that this store is closing soon (in a few minutes)</li>
	<li><code class="java">isNear</code> determines that this store is near you</li>
</ul>

<p>Write a boolean expression that is <code class="java">true</code> if at least one condition is true:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the store is not closing soon</li>
	<li>the store is near you</li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise, the expression is <code class="java">false</code>.</p>
