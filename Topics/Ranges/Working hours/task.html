<h2>Working hours</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The car wash works from 9 to 18 (we use a 24-hour clock format), and from 13 to 14, its employees take lunch to refuel and recharge for further work.<br/>
As input, our program reads an integer, a positive number from the console, which is the desired time to make a reservation at the car wash, and checks whether the entered time is within the working hours.</p>
<p>If the time is within the range of working hours, return <code class="java">true</code>, but if the time is during lunch or outside the working hours, return <code class="java">false</code>.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">10</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">true</code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">23</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">false</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
